# Adding one-to-one rooms to your Ionic 4 chat app

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to add one-to-one chat rooms to a chat application built using Ionic 4 (With Angular), Nest.js and Chatkit. 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

You need to have a basic understanding of TypeScript and Node.js to follow this tutorial. 

TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. Both Nest.js and Ionic 4 (based on Angular) requires TypeScript so you need to be familiar with it.

You also need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine, if they are not installed on your system, you simply need to head to the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) and grab the binaries for your system or refer to your operating system instructions for installing Node.js via the official package manager of your system.

First, clone the repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/techiediaries/chatkit-one-to-one-rooms.git

```
Next, navigate inside the server project and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd chatkit-one-to-one-rooms/server
npm install
```

Next, start the development server:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```


## Built With

* [Pusher's Chatkit](https://docs.pusher.com/chatkit) - APIs to enable devs building chat apps
